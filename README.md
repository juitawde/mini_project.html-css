## 🚀 Project Overview

AdventureCo is a responsive travel website educational project designed using HTML and CSS to demonstrate front-end web development skills. The website showcases travel destinations, curated tours, imagery, and testimonials for demonstration purposes only. It does not represent a real travel service and does not offer actual bookings. The project is inspired by professional travel platforms such as Intrepid Travel, which served only as a design reference for learning and practice.
